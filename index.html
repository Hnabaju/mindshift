	<h1>Assignment week 1</h1>
	<ul>
        <li>Slow learners. By using persistence and flexibility, slow learners, can see things that geniuses miss.</li><br>
         <p>As am learning programming, I haven't learnt a lecture and mastered it in one bit, i have always gone back and forth to reveiw my from the finished projects and now am trying to at some extent to code on my own where i review just to comfirm whether what i did was right or wrong </p><br>

        <li>Active learning. Try to actively do whatever you are trying to learn.</li><br>
        <p>This is the most effective tool of learning, at first i used to write the codes in the book so i never got to try them out on the computer and every thing seemed difficult.
        And after we were given our first coding assignment i wasn't sure of my codes in the book since i got problems of combining them together and from then whenever i follow the lecture while coding on my computer which makes it easy to know where i have gone wrong.</p><br>

        <li>Mastery learning. Whether you learn it quickly or slowly, you can still learn it!</li><br>
        <p>A big yes, am lagigging behind since most of my fellows are good and faster, but i have always told my self to move on my own pace as long as understand the details of what am learning </p><br>

        <li>The value of your past. Seemingly unconnected knowledge from your past can bring unexpected assets to your work in the present. Remember— it's typical to feel incompetent when you first try to change.</li>

        <p>I love sports and engage in sports activities with in an allocated time where also i find my teammates faster in running and of low weight but still am keeping in mind that as long as i know how to control and pass then i can do my best there as i improve the speed with more training and time</p><br>

        <li>Focused and diffuse modes of thinking bring very different insights into your learning.</li><br>
        <p>yes, at times i understand things after concentrating and at times i have to think of different things </p><br>

        <li>Match passions with opportunities. It’s important to take a strategic as well as a passion influenced approach to your learning. Work to broaden, not just follow, your passions.</li><br>
        <p>Choosing something you are passionate about creates an inner desire of self drive more so if it can help you financially, socially and improve your wellbeing, i chose programing because am passionate about it because of its un ending knowledge and ever advancing technlogies which create more job opportunities</p><br>

        <li>The role of the environment around you. Who you hang out with, and the environment you live and work in, can make a difference in your behavior. Occasional small disruptions, as with the clinking in a coffee shop, can sometimes enhance bigger picture learning. (Also, complex systems shouldn't just be memorized!)</li><br>
        <p>Emotionally the sorrounding does a great work where at times you are inspired to engage in something forexample, i talked about myself engaging in sports activities, here when yoyu know that you have got the support of the spectators you are bound to push yourself to do better not to dissapoint their support</p>
        <br>

     <h1>How I plan to use the above information in the future</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Am improving in impleting the learning strategies since programing requires more dedication</li><br>
            <li>Understanding that speed doesn't matter as long as am understanding what am doing</li><br>
            <li>Fully engaging in whatever am trying to learn, doing assignments on my own, evaluating myself on how far i have learnt </li>
            <li>Knowing that whatever i do and wherever i am, it has everything to improve on my knowledge and understanding</li>
        </ol>
